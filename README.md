To run the simulations, simply run the `main.py` file. All classes and code is contained
in that file. You will find different experiments that are run at the bottom of the file.

```commandline
python main.py
```

Results of the experiments in terms of figures are opened while the experiment runs. Log
messages will also appear in the CLI for better understanding. The figures are saves in 
the location `/figrues/*`.
